## Key Concepts

### Zero-NAT Architecture
A cost-effective AWS VPC architecture that eliminates NAT Gateways while maintaining secure outbound internet access for private resources.

### Hybrid Subnets
Subnets that have direct internet connectivity through the Internet Gateway but are protected by security groups and NACLs.

### Security Boundaries
In Zero-NAT architecture, security is enforced primarily through security groups and NACLs rather than network isolation.

## Cost Savings

The Zero-NAT architecture can provide significant cost savings:

| Resource | Traditional Architecture | Zero-NAT Architecture | Monthly Savings |
|----------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| NAT Gateway | $32.40 per NAT × 2 AZs = $64.80 | $0 | $64.80 |
| Data Processing | ~$45 for 1TB outbound | ~$45 for 1TB outbound | $0 |
| **Total** | **~$109.80** | **~$45** | **~$64.80** |

## Use Cases

### Ideal For
- Development and testing environments
- Cost-sensitive production workloads
- Startups and small businesses
- Modern cloud-native applications

### Not Recommended For
- Highly regulated environments requiring complete network isolation
- Legacy applications that rely on network-level security
- Environments where instances must never have public IP addresses
