# Security Considerations for Zero-NAT Architecture

This document outlines the security considerations, best practices, and mitigations for implementing the Zero-NAT architecture.

## Understanding the Security Model

The Zero-NAT architecture differs from traditional AWS architectures in its network isolation approach:

### Traditional Architecture Security Model
- Private subnets have no direct internet connectivity
- NAT Gateways provide controlled outbound internet access
- Network-level isolation is the primary security boundary

### Zero-NAT Architecture Security Model
- Hybrid subnets have direct internet connectivity through IGW
- Security groups and NACLs become the primary security boundary
- Defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers

## Security Layers in Zero-NAT Architecture

### 1. VPC Design

- **Subnet Segregation**: Clear separation between public, hybrid, and private tiers
- **CIDR Planning**: Non-overlapping CIDR blocks with room for expansion
- **Private Subnet Isolation**: Database tier remains completely isolated from the internet

### 2. Security Groups

Security groups are the primary defense mechanism in the Zero-NAT architecture:

#### ALB Security Group
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "alb" {
  name        = "alb-sg"
  description = "Security group for ALB"
  vpc_id      = module.vpc.vpc_id
  
  # Allow HTTP/HTTPS from internet
  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    description = "HTTP from internet"
  }
  
  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    description = "HTTPS from internet"
  }
  
  # Restrict outbound to VPC only
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = [module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block]
    description = "All traffic to VPC only"
  }
}
```

#### Application Security Group
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "app" {
  name        = "app-sg"
  description = "Security group for application servers"
  vpc_id      = module.vpc.vpc_id
  
  # Allow traffic only from ALB
  ingress {
    from_port       = 8080
    to_port         = 8080
    protocol        = "tcp"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.alb.id]
    description     = "Traffic from ALB only"
  }
  
  # Allow only necessary outbound traffic
  egress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    description = "HTTPS to internet for API calls"
  }
  
  egress {
    from_port       = 3306
    to_port         = 3306
    protocol        = "tcp"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.db.id]
    description     = "MySQL to database"
  }
}
```

#### Database Security Group
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "db" {
  name        = "db-sg"
  description = "Security group for database servers"
  vpc_id      = module.vpc.vpc_id
  
  # Allow traffic only from application servers
  ingress {
    from_port       = 3306
    to_port         = 3306
    protocol        = "tcp"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.app.id]
    description     = "MySQL from application servers only"
  }
  
  # No outbound internet access
  # Default is no egress rules
}
```

### 3. Network ACLs (NACLs)

NACLs provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level:

#### Public Subnet NACL
- Allow HTTP/HTTPS inbound from anywhere
- Allow ephemeral ports inbound for return traffic
- Allow all outbound to VPC CIDR
- Allow outbound to internet on HTTP/HTTPS ports

#### Hybrid Subnet NACL
- Allow inbound only from ALB subnets on application port
- Allow ephemeral ports inbound for return traffic
- Allow outbound to database subnets on database port
- Allow outbound to internet on HTTP/HTTPS ports only

#### Private Subnet NACL
- Allow inbound only from application subnets on database port
- Allow ephemeral ports inbound for return traffic
- Deny all outbound internet access
- Allow outbound to VPC CIDR only

### 4. IAM Roles and Policies

- Use IAM roles with least privilege for all resources
- Implement instance profiles for EC2 instances
- Use service roles for managed services (ECS, RDS, etc.)
- Regularly audit and rotate credentials

### 5. Encryption

- Enable encryption for all data at rest
  - EBS volumes
  - RDS databases
  - S3 buckets
- Use TLS for all data in transit
  - HTTPS for all external traffic
  - TLS for internal service communication

### 6. Monitoring and Logging

- Enable VPC Flow Logs to monitor network traffic
- Configure CloudTrail for API activity monitoring
- Set up CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activity
- Implement centralized logging solution

## Security Comparison: Traditional vs. Zero-NAT

| Security Aspect | Traditional Architecture | Zero-NAT Architecture | Mitigation in Zero-NAT |
|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Network Isolation | Strong - Private subnets have no direct internet access | Moderate - Hybrid subnets have direct internet access | Strict security groups and NACLs |
| Attack Surface | Smaller - NAT Gateway is the only outbound path | Larger - Each instance has potential internet access | Limit outbound traffic to specific ports/destinations |
| Lateral Movement | Limited by subnet isolation | Limited by security groups | Implement strict security group rules |
| Monitoring | Standard VPC Flow Logs | Standard VPC Flow Logs | Enhanced monitoring and alerting |
| Cost of Security | Higher - NAT Gateways add cost | Lower - No NAT Gateway cost | Invest savings in additional security controls |

## Security Best Practices for Zero-NAT

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant only the permissions necessary for resources to function
- Regularly audit and remove unused permissions

### 2. Defense in Depth
- Implement multiple security layers
- Don't rely solely on network isolation

### 3. Secure Configuration
- Harden all operating systems and applications
- Remove unnecessary services and open ports
- Use security benchmarks (CIS, AWS Security Hub)

### 4. Regular Updates
- Keep all systems patched and updated
- Implement automated patching where possible

### 5. Monitoring and Incident Response
- Implement comprehensive monitoring
- Develop and test incident response procedures
- Set up automated alerting for security events

### 6. Security Testing
- Conduct regular vulnerability assessments
- Perform penetration testing
- Use infrastructure as code security scanning tools

## Compliance Considerations

The Zero-NAT architecture may require additional controls for certain compliance frameworks:

### PCI DSS
- Additional segmentation controls may be needed
- Enhanced monitoring and logging
- Regular penetration testing

### HIPAA
- Ensure all PHI is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Implement additional access controls
- Comprehensive audit logging

### SOC 2
- Document security controls and procedures
- Implement change management processes
- Regular security assessments

## Conclusion

The Zero-NAT architecture trades traditional network isolation for a more cost-effective approach that relies on security groups, NACLs, and other AWS security controls. With proper implementation of the security measures outlined in this document, the Zero-NAT architecture can provide a secure environment for most workloads while significantly reducing costs.

For highly regulated environments or those with strict compliance requirements, additional security controls may be necessary, or a traditional architecture with NAT Gateways might be more appropriate.
